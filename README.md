Program to generate weekly menu

Very much a work in progress


`python3 -m venv .venv`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`



### Setup

Create a directory named `data`.
Create a file named `meals.txt` in the `data` directory.
Add meals by name. One per line. No need to use commas.

Example:

```
salad
pizza
burger
etc.
```
